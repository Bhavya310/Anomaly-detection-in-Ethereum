# Anomaly-detection-in-Ethereum
This project involves processing Ethereum blockchain transaction data to:
Map addresses to unique integer IDs consistently across datasets.
Extract and filter transactions based on smart contract behavior. 
Generate day-wise cleaned transaction datasets and filtered outputs for anomaly detection and further analysis.
from anomaly 2 file:
I have taken the zero values transactions nodes and i also consider the extra conditions and after all that i have extracted the smart contract ones separately and i have used the scoring system for identifying the nodes and found the transactions of anomaly nodes by using these transactions i have plotted the graphs and obeserved the brust periods.
from anomaly 3 file:
Read a node file (contract.txt) and extract nodes where contract type = 2. 
Save them into a new file (confinall.txt). Load these flipping nodes. 
Filter transactions from day-wise outputs to include only transactions involving these nodes. 
Save the filtered results (filtered_flipping_nodes_transactions.txt).
I have plotted the graph by using this file and analyzied the nodes by using the brust periods.
